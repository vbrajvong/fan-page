The game features popular Nintendo characters such as Mario, Link, Donkey Kong and even more. The most current installment of the series includes 58 playable characters that also includes popular third-party characters such as Megaman, Pac-man and even Cloud from the Final Fantasy series. While the creator of the series initially designed Super Smash Bros to be a party game with four players being able to play at the same time, the second installment of the series brought up a community of players who brought the game to a competitive level. </p>
        <h2>Competitive</h2>
        <p>The second installment, Super Smash Bros. Melee sparked a competitive scene that still thrives today with prize pools that reach over $20,000. Early tournaments were extremely informal and usually were hosted in people's homes, or the occasional game store with rules still being disputed between regions such as the East and West Coast. As the competitive scene rose, tournament sponsors such as the MLG (Major League Gaming) put a lot of focus on Smash Bros Melee during the years of 2006 though 2007, offering the top players hefty prize earnings for the top players. Players during those years called this the "Golden Age" of competitive Super Smash Bros. Events and professional players today recieve attention from a wide variety of sponsors such as HTC, ASUS, and even Nintendo themselves. Players can even make salary from attending bigger tournaments with the top player today making a total of $113,246 from tournament earnings. To this day, almost every installment of this series is practiced and played competitively.
